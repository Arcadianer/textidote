\title{My Paper}
\maketitle

A first paragraph with some stuff, some \textbf{bold text}   and other things, like a citation\cite{my:paper} .The text is  not evenly spaced.

Here,I forget to put a space after a comma. I refer to \ref{fig:thisfig1} in the text, but I do not refer to the second one. I can mention a filename such as \verb+myfile.txt+; some rules don't apply to this special markup; however, if I write myfile.txt, I'm likely to get a warning about a period not followed by a space.

\section{a first section}

Some other text, part of which is <<special>>, very "special".
